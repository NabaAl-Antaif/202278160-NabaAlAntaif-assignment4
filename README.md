## AI use
In this project i have used AI tools to help me in design, style, and link JavaScript with HTML element. I was facing difficulties in styling my website and the section looked very boring, so using GitHub Copilot helps me to add some effects to my components. Also, the JavaScript part was confusing me because I did not know how to use the HTML elements inside it, so ChatGPT explained to me how I can do that. I have learned new things and improve my skills through using AI tools effectively.

### GitHub Copilot

* Generated the project card styling and helped make them interactive.
* Generated the form section styling.
* Show redundant line in the CSS file and delete them.

### ChatGPT

* Provided design suggestions.
* Explained JavaScript concepts
* Explained Markdown (.md) file syntax.

### Microsoft Copilot

* Generate the style of the toggle button and make it interactive
* Explained how to add a count down to the message
* Analyze the lighthouse report and help me fix some issues
* How to remember the theme the user choose
